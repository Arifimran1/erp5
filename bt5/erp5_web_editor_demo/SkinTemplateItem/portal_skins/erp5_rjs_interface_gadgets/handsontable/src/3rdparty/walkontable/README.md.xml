# Walkontable\n
\n
This is a playground for next table view engine that will enable virtual rendering in [Handsontable](http://handsontable.com/).\n
\n
Works in IE8+, FF3.6+, latest Opera, Safari and Chrome.\n
\n
Built with almost full TDD test coverage (Jasmine).\n
\n
## Bugs\n
\n
This code was created with the intention to be used as part of Handsontable and will only be supported by the author\n
when used in that way. This may change in future. Thanks for understanding.\n
\n
## Design considerations\n
