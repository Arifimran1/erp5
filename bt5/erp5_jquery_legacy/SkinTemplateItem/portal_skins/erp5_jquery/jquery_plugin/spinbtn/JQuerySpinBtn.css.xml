/*\n
\tStyles to make ordinary <INPUT type="text"/> look like a spinbutton/spinbox control.\n
\tUse with JQuerySpinBtn.js to provide the spin functionality by reacting to mouse etc.\n
\t(Requires a reference to the JQuery library found at http://jquery.com/src/latest/)\n
\t(Hats-off to John Resig for creating the excellent JQuery library. It is fab.)\n
\n
\tThis control is achieved with no extra html markup whatsoever and uses unobtrusive javascript.\n
\n

\tBig improvements added by Mark Gibson, (mgibson@designlinks.net) September 2006.\n
\n
\tDo contact me with comments and suggestions but please don\'t ask for support.\n
\tAs much as I\'d love to help with specific problems I have plenty to get on with already!\n
\n
\tGo ahead and use it in your own projects. This code is provided \'as is\'.\n
\tSure I\'ve tested in heaps of ways. Its good for me, but you use it at your own risk.\n
\tSoftwareUnity and I are certainly not responsible if your computer sets fire to the sofa,\n
\thacks into the pentagon, hijacks a plane or gives you any kind of hassle whatsoever.\n
\n
\tIf you\'d like your spin-button image in a different place then you\'ll need to alter both\n
\tthe CSS below and the javascript isMouseOverUpDn() function to accommodate the new position.\n
\tYou could even have left and right buttons either side of the textbox.\n

INPUT.spin-button {\n
