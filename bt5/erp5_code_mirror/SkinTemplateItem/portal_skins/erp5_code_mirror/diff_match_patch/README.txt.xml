\n
This library is currently available in seven different ports, all using the same API.\n
Every version includes a full set of unit tests.\n
\n
C++:\n
* Ported by Mike Slemmer.\n
* Currently requires the Qt library.\n
\n
C#:\n
* Ported by Matthaeus G. Chajdas.\n
\n
Dart:\n
* The Dart language is still growing and evolving, so this port is only as\n
  stable as the underlying language.\n
\n
Java:\n
* Included is both the source and a Maven package.\n
\n
JavaScript:\n
* diff_match_patch_uncompressed.js is the human-readable version.\n
  Users of node.js should \'require\' this uncompressed version since the\n
  compressed version is not guaranteed to work outside of a web browser.\n
* diff_match_patch.js has been compressed using Google\'s internal JavaScript compressor.\n
  Non-Google hackers who wish to recompress the source can use:\n
  http://dean.edwards.name/packer/\n
\n
Lua:\n
* Ported by Duncan Cross.\n
* Does not support line-mode speedup.\n
\n
Objective C:\n
* Ported by Jan Weiss.\n
* Includes speed test (this is a separate bundle for other languages).\n
\n
Python:\n
* Two versions, one for Python 2.x, the other for Python 3.x.\n
* Runs 10x faster under PyPy than CPython.\n
\n
Demos:\n
* Separate demos for Diff, Match and Patch in JavaScript.\n
