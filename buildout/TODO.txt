 - global build requirement checker
   - needs recipe
   - needs per profile dependency declaration
 - implement declared parts (*/buildout.cfg empty)
 - merge from:
  - https://svn.erp5.org/repos/public/experimental/erp5.buildout-zope-2.12/
 - use more of buildout automatic dependency resolution
 - software-profiles/openoffice-bin.cfg:
   - consider using own recipe or zorg.recipe.openoffice, which would be
     closer to buildout usage (internal cache, etc)
 - add bin/ and var/bin/ to path
 - if software do not provide instance, put its binaries to bin/
 - use declarative way of selecting in-buildout dependencies
     For example mysql-python egg is build against locally built mysql, but
     version of mysql is hardcoded in mysql-python egg part.
 - have all eggs available as software, but use them selectively in instances
 - convert all ERP5 products into eggs, but allow in development profile to
   have them locally editable and commitable (develop)
 - binaries generated by software buildout shall have precedence in PATH in
   software *and* instance buildouts
 - make eggs defined with standalone instance recipe inside instance instead
   of globally for buildout
 - update software-profiles/apache.cfg to build fully modular apache (with ssl,
   cache, etc) which will give full control while creating apache instances
 - check if all profiles are working in networked way - that no checkout of
   buildout structure is required, so it is possible to use extend over the
   network
