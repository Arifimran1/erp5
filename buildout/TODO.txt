 - global build requirement checker
   - needs recipe
   - needs per profile dependency declaration
 - software-profiles/openoffice-bin.cfg:
   - consider using own recipe or zorg.recipe.openoffice, which would be
     closer to buildout usage (internal cache, etc)
 - if software do not provide instance, put its binaries to bin/
 - convert all ERP5 products into eggs, but allow in development profile to
   have them locally editable and commitable (develop)
 - binaries generated by software buildout shall have precedence in PATH in
   software *and* instance buildouts
 - make eggs defined with standalone instance recipe inside instance instead
   of globally for buildout
 - update software-profiles/apache.cfg to build fully modular apache (with ssl,
   cache, etc) which will give full control while creating apache instances
