 - global build requirement checker
   - needs recipe
   - needs per profile dependency declaration
 - software-profiles/openoffice-bin.cfg:
   - consider using own recipe or zorg.recipe.openoffice, which would be
     closer to buildout usage (internal cache, etc)
 - make eggs defined with standalone instance recipe inside instance instead
   of globally for buildout
