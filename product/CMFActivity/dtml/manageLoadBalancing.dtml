<p class="form-help">
  This tab defines the Load Balancing of Activities.
  To provide high performance, the activities are distributed over several ZEO clients, called <i>nodes</i>,
  so that they can be processed in parallel. Nodes can either run on different machines or on one machine
  with different Port Numbers.
  The format to adress a node in this configuration is therfore
  <code>IP-Address</code>:<code>Port-Number</code>.
</p>

<p class="form-help">
  The interval of distribution and activation of the activities is per default 5 seconds. This can be
  changed by altering the value of <i>interval</i> in the section <i>time-server</i> in the
  Zope Configuration File <i>zope.conf</i>.
</p>

<p class="form-help">
    The <i>Distributing node</i> is responsible for the Load Distribution. The default value is empty
    which means that every existing node will try to do the distribution, which is fine when there
    is only one ZServer running.
    To change the Distributing Node, edit the value and click &quot;Change&quot;.
