    A conduit is a piece of code in charge of

    - updating an object attributes from an XUpdate XML stream

    (Conduits are not in charge of creating new objects which
    are eventually missing in a synchronisation process)

    If an object has be created during a synchronisation process,
    the way to proceed consists in:

    1- creating an empty instance of the appropriate class
      in the appropriate directory

    2- updating that empty instance with the conduit

    The first implementation of ERP5 synchronisation
    will define a default location to create new objects and
    a default class. This will be defined at the level of the synchronisation
    tool

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
    Look carefully when we are adding elements,
    for example, when we do 'insert-after', with 2 xupdate:element,
    so adding 2 differents objects, actually it adds only XXXX one XXX object
    In this case the getSubObjectDepth(), doesn't have
    too much sence
    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

    XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    There is also one problem, when we synchronize a conflict, 
    we are not waiting
    the response of the client, so that we are not sure if it take into account,
    we may have CONFLICT_NOT_SYNCHRONIZED AND CONFLICT_SYNCHRONIZED
