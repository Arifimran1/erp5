    The BusinessPath class embeds all information related to
    lead times and parties involved at a given phase of a business
    process.

    BusinessPath are also used as helper to build deliveries from
    buildable movements.

    The idea is to invoke isBuildable() on the collected simulation
    movements (which are orphan) during build "after select" process

    Here is the typical code of an alarm in charge of the building process::

      builder = portal_deliveries.a_delivery_builder
      for business_path in builder.getDeliveryBuilderRelatedValueList():
        builder.build(causality_uid=business_path.getUid(),) # Select movements

      Pros: global select is possible by not providing a causality_uid
      Cons: global select retrieves long lists of orphan movements which
              are not yet buildable
            the build process could be rather slow or require activities
