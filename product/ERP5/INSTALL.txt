Requirements

  The following components are required in order to use ERP5:

  - Zope (www.zope.org)

  - Zope CMF including workflow, default and topicsi (cmf.zope.org)

  - Localizer (www.nuxeo.org)

  - CMFWiki (www.zope.org)

  - Base18 (also in the ERP5 CVS on Savannah)

  - BTreeFolder2 (http://hathaway.freezope.org/Software/BTreeFolder2)
  
  - Refresh

  - CmfPhoto (http://smets.com/static/Mandrake/SOURCES/CMFPhoto-1.2.3.tar.bz2)

Installation

  Put the ERP5 CVS folder in the /var/lib/zope/Products 
  directory or equivalent. Copy the demo.zexp and images.zexp
  of the import directory to /var/lib/zope/import. Import
  demo.zexp and images.zexp at your root folder. Use the 
  user 'jp' (user: jp passwd: jp) to try ERP5 components

  Quirks
  
    It is necessary to refresh the ERP5 product in order
    to use it because it is based on Formulator and Formulator
    is loaded after ERP5 by Zope at startup
