    Represent decision took during solving divergence between reality and

    Provides possibility to override movement's property value in case of
    accepting decision with forcing.

    Properties are two types - historical only and really used.

    Historical only are for information traceability:

      * delivery_solver_name
      * target_solver_name

    Really used shall impact property value of movement:

      * divergence
      * decision
      * force_property

    divergence
      instance of DivergenceMessage

    decision
      string representing took decision:
        * accept
        * adopt
        * split

    delivery_solver_name
      delivery solver used during taking decision

    target_solver_name
      target solver used during taking decision

    force_property
      If set, property on decision overrides

      Dictionary passed to TargetSolver in case of splitting.
