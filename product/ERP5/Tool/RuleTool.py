    The RulesTool implements portal object
    transformation policies.

    An object transformation template is defined by
    a domain and a transformation pattent:

    The domain is defined as:

    - the meta_type it applies to

    - the portal_type it applies to

    - the conditions of application (category membership, value range,
      security, function, etc.)

    The transformation template is defined as:

    - a tree of portal_types starting on the object itself

    - default values for each node of the tree, incl. the root itself

    When a transformation is triggered, it will check the existence of
    each node and eventually update values

    Transformations are very similar to XSLT in the XML world.

    Examples of applications:

    - generate accounting movements from a stock movement

    - generate a birthday event from a person

    ERP5 main application : generate submovements from movements
    according to templates. Allows to parametrize modules
    such as payroll.

    Try to mimic: XSL semantics
